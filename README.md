### What I learned

During this project, I explored how to build a responsive form layout with the following features:

- Using Flexbox for the form layout to manage multi-column designs.
- Implementing responsive design with media queries to adapt the form for mobile devices.
- Customizing select elements with CSS and embedding custom SVG icons as dropdown arrows.
- Utilizing CSS properties like background-image, background-size, and background-position to integrate a custom background for the entire page.
- Handling form elements with appearance: none; to override default styles and create a uniform design.

### Useful resources

CSS Tricks: Custom Select Styles - This article provided guidance on how to customize the <select> dropdown.
MDN Web Docs - A valuable resource for CSS syntax and techniques.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Flexbox for responsive layout
- Media Queries for mobile adaptation


## Features

This site was created as a submission to a DevChallenges challenge. The goal was to build a contact page that is:

Responsive across different devices, including desktops and mobile phones.
Styled with custom dropdown arrows using SVG for better design consistency.
Accessible, with clear and readable form labels.

## Acknowledgements
